# ml-isoperim
This is the repository for my code for my SURP project for summer 2020, "Functional Approximations for the Isoperimetric Problem using Machine-Learning methods". It seeks to solve the isoperimetric problem in polar coordinates, modified to have a weight function added to the calculation of the area.
